#### Description:

Crime Report Web App is a web-based application that allows any user to anonymously report a crime scene in any location. This web app consists of three main pages- homepage, recent crimes page, and a contact page.

The homepage-- 'Report a Crime'. This is the page where users first land in when they open the web app. This page allows user to enter necessary information regarding the incident or crime they witnessed.
First of all, the type of crime that includes theft, vandalism, assault or murder. Secondly, the user has to type in the exact location of the incident. The date must be typed in the dd/mm/yyyy format or can be simply chosen from the calender icon manually. Similarly, the approximate time should be input as well. It can be typed or manually chosen. Users are expected to provide vivid description of the crime scene in order to make it easier for he authority to take quicker action. Lastly, the user may choose an image file as a form of evidence but it is optional. However, rest of the fields are required in order to submit the report.

'Recent Crimes'-- this page shows a list of all the recent crimes that have taken place and have been reported. The information is displayed in a tabular format. The evidences are shown beside the respective crime descriptions. If no evidence is provided, the block  will simply show 'No evidence available'. The rest of the information such as type of crime, location, date, time and description will be displayed as it is.

Lastly, 'Contact Us'-- this page allows user to directly contact relavant authority who are connected to the web app or can provide help or take action. There are contact information of the local police department and a crime response team (I have made a fake email address and a fake contact number under these names). A user may also reach out through form where they must provide their full name, email address and their message which could be any important information they wish to share, any comments, suggestions or advice or simply any queries.
